# Fourier Series and Transform

## What are Fourier Series and Transform?

Fourier Series and Transform are mathematical techniques used to represent a function as a sum of simpler functions, called harmonics or sine waves. These tools allow us to decompose complex signals into their constituent frequencies.

### Fourier Transform

The Fourier Transform is an mathematical operation that transforms a function in the time domain to its frequency domain representation. It's denoted by the symbol X(f) and represents the amplitude and phase of each frequency component present in the original signal.

In mathematics, the Fourier Transform is defined as:

X(f) = ∫∞ -∞ x(t)e^{-i2πft}dt

where x(t) is the input function, f is the frequency, and t is time.

### Applications of Fourier Series and Transform

Fourier Series and Transform have numerous applications in various fields, including:

*   Signal Processing: Filtering, Modulation, Demodulation
*   Image Processing: Image Filtering, Reconstruction
*   Audio Processing: Audio Filter Design, Sound Synthesis
*   Physics: Wave Phenomena, Harmonics

### Key Concepts

*   **Periodicity**: A periodic function can be represented as a sum of sine waves with frequencies that are integer multiples of a fundamental frequency.
*   **Orthogonality**: Sine and cosine functions are orthogonal to each other, meaning that their inner product is zero.

# Fourier Series

## What are Fourier Series?

A Fourier Series is a mathematical representation of a periodic function as a sum of simpler functions called harmonics or sine waves. These tools allow us to decompose complex signals into their constituent frequencies.

### Periodicity

Fourier Series are particularly useful for representing periodic functions, which can be expressed as a sum of sine waves with frequencies that are integer multiples of a fundamental frequency. This property enables us to capture the repeating patterns in a signal using a finite number of terms.

## Key Concepts

*   **Harmonics**: The harmonics are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, representing different frequencies present in the original signal.
*   **Sine Waves**: The sine waves form the basis of the Fourier Series, with each wave corresponding to a specific harmonic.
