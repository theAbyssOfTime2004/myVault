```python
min_stack = []

def push(x):
    if not min_stack or x <= min_stack[-1]:
        min_stack.append(x)
```

In this code, `min_stack` is a list that keeps track of the minimum values. The `push` function checks if `min_stack` is empty or if the value `x` is less than or equal to the last element of `min_stack`. If either condition is true, it appends `x` to `min_stack`.

```python
min_stack = []

def push(x):
    if not min_stack or x <= min_stack[-1]:
        min_stack.append(x)
    else:
        min_stack.append(min_stack[-1])
```

In this code, if the condition `not min_stack or x <= min_stack[-1]` is not met, the `else` block executes, appending the current minimum value (the last element of `min_stack`) to `min_stack`. This effectively repeats the previous minimum value.

tại sao stack[-1] là phần tử cuối cùng trong stack

In Python, lists are used to implement stacks, and they provide methods to manipulate the stack elements. The expression `stack[-1]` is used to access the last element of the list `stack`. This is because Python supports negative indexing for lists, where `-1` refers to the last element, `-2` to the second last, and so on. This allows you to easily access the top element of the stack without needing to know the current size of the stack.
