# LLAM Wrappers and Prompt Templates in the LangChain Framework
=====================================

### Introduction
The LangChain framework is a popular library for building conversational AI models, particularly those utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs). In this response, we'll explore what LLM wrappers and prompt templates are within the context of the LangChain framework.

### LLAM Wrappers
An LLAM wrapper is a module that wraps around an LLM to enhance its functionality or adapt it for specific use cases. The primary purpose of an LLAM wrapper is to provide additional interfaces, logic, or constraints to the underlying model, allowing users to tailor its behavior and improve its performance.

Some examples of LLAM wrappers include:
- **`LLMWrapper`**: A base class for building custom LLM wrappers.
- **`ConversationalLLMWrapper`**: Wraps an LLM with conversational AI capabilities.
- **`TextGenLLMWrapper`**: Enhances the `LLMWrapper` to generate text.

### Prompt Templates
A prompt template is a pre-defined format used to craft input prompts for the LLM. It helps in fine-tuning the model's performance by controlling what information it considers relevant during inference.

Some common techniques using prompt templates include:

- ****Template Injection**: Substituting placeholders with meaningful values.
- **`LLM Template`**: Customizable templates like `question`, `story`, or `description`.

By utilizing well-crafted prompt templates, users can maximize the LLM's capabilities and elicit specific responses from it.
