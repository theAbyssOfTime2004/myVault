**Potential Issue Identification**

Based on the provided query, it appears that you are experiencing issues related to a process using port 8000, which may be conflicting with another application or service.

To investigate further, I would recommend running the following commands:

*   `netstat -ano | findstr :8000`: This command will display a list of all processes currently using port 8000, including the process ID (PID) and the name of the process.
*   `taskkill /PID <PID> /F`: If you encounter a conflicting process, this command can be used to terminate it. Make sure to replace `<PID>` with the actual PID of the process you want to terminate.
*   `tasklist /FI "PID eq <PID>"`: This command will provide more detailed information about the specific process, including its name, image path, and other relevant details.

**Possible Scenarios**

There are several possible scenarios that could be causing this issue:

1.  **Conflicting Application**: Another application or service may be using port 8000, causing conflicts with your own application.
2.  **Malware or Virus**: Malicious software may have infected your system and is utilizing port 8000 without your knowledge.
3.  **System Configuration Issues**: Incorrect system configuration or settings may be causing the issue.

**Recommendation**

To resolve the issue, I would recommend checking the process list to identify the conflicting application or service, and then taking appropriate action to terminate it. If you're unable to identify the source of the conflict, further investigation may be necessary to determine the root cause of the problem.

Please let me know if there's any further assistance I can provide.
