        "content": "It seems that you're using an older version of the Llama model that was released before the \"latest\" version.\n\nThe reason why there's only `llama3.2:latest` as an option is likely due to one of the following reasons:\n\n1. **Limited download options**: Some platforms or tools might not have the capability to display a wide range of model versions, especially if they're not actively maintained. In this case, the \"latest\" version might be the most recent stable release.\n2. **Model updates and maintenance**: The Llama 3.2 model is constantly being updated and improved by Meta AI researchers. These updates can sometimes break compatibility with older versions or limit the available options for users. This might result in newer models not being displayed as an option, even if they're still widely used.\n3. **Architecture or environment limitations**: Depending on your setup and environment, certain Llama model architectures or versions might not be compatible or supported.\n\nIf you have pulled the `ollama` model to your PC, it's possible that:\n\n1. **The \"latest\" label is not accurate for your system**: It's possible that the version displayed as \"latest\" might not be the actual latest release, but rather a stable version or a specific variant.\n2. **Your environment doesn't support newer Llama versions**: As mentioned earlier, some architectures or environments might not be compatible with newer Llama models.\n\nIf you're looking to use more recent Llama models on your PC, I recommend checking the following options:\n\n1. **Check the Meta AI website for updates and model releases**: Visit the official Meta AI website to see if there are any new Llama model releases that might support your needs.\n2. **Reach out to the community or developers**: If you're having trouble finding a suitable version, try reaching out to the communities, forums, or documentation teams related to the Llama models.\n\nKeep in mind that using outdated or unsupported models can lead to compatibility issues, performance problems, or even errors.\n\nDo you have any further questions about this, or would you like help exploring alternative solutions?",
