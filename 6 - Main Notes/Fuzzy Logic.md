- Fuzzy logic reflects how people think. It attempts to model our sense of words, our decision making and our common sense. As a result, leading to new, more human and intelligent system
- represent truth values to all real number in the interval $(0;1)$
	- For example, the possibility that a man 181cm tall is really tall might be set to a value of 0.86. It is likely that the man is tall.
- 1965 Zadeh published paper about "Fuzzy sets"
- Unlke binary boolean logic, fuzzy logic is multi-valued, uses the continuum of logical values betwwen 0 (completely false) and 1 (completely true)
- Fuzzy logic is a set of mathematical principles for knowledge representation based on degrees of membership
