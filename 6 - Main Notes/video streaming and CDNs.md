# video streaming and CDNs
**context**: 
- stream video traffic: major consumer of internet bandwith
	- Netflix, Youtube, Amazon Prime: 80% of residential ISP traffic (2020)
- challenge: scale - how to reach ~1B users? 
	- single mega-video server won't work because:
		- - **High Latency:** Users located far from the server would experience delays.
		- **Bandwidth Limitations:** A single server cannot handle the immense amount of traffic simultaneously.
		- **Single Point of Failure:** If the server goes down, all users lose access.
		- **Overload Risks:** The server would be overwhelmed by billions of requests.
- challenge: heterogeneity
	- different users have different capabilities (e.g., wired versus mobile; bandwith rich versus bandwith poor)
- ***solution: distributed, application - level infrastructure***
### Multimedia: video 
- video: sequence of images display at constant rate (e.g., 24 fps)
- digital image: array of pixels 
	- each pixel represented by bits
- coding: use redundancy *within* and *between* images to decrease # bits used to encode image
	- spatial (within image)
	- temporal (from one image to next)

- **CBR: (constant bit rate)**: video encoding rate fixed
- **VBR: (variable bit rate)**: video encoding rate changes as amount of spatial, temporal coding changes
- example:
	- MPEG (CD-ROM) 1.5 MBPS
	- MPEG2 (DVD) 3-6 MBPS
	- MPEG4 (often used in Internet, 64Kbps - 12Mbps)

### Streaming stored video
![[Pasted image 20250103180840.png]]
- **Main challenges**:
	- server-to-client bandwidth will *vary* orver time, with changing network congestion levels (in house, in access network, in network core, at video server)
	- packet loss and delay due to congestion will delay playout, or result in poor video quality

**Other challenges**:
-  *Continuous Playout Constraint:*
	-  Once the client starts playing the video, the playback must follow the **original timing** of the video (no delays or interruptions).
	- **Challenge:**
	    - **Variable network delays (jitter):**
	        - The time it takes for video packets to travel from the server to the client can vary due to network congestion or other issues.
	        - This variability can cause interruptions in playback if the client doesnâ€™t receive packets on time.
    - **Solution:**
	    -  A **client-side buffer** is used.
        - This buffer temporarily stores incoming video packets to ensure smooth playback by compensating for jitter.

 - *Client Interactivity:*
	- Modern streaming services allow users to:
    - **Pause, fast-forward, rewind, or jump** to a specific part of the video.
	- **Challenge:**
	    - These actions require the server to quickly fetch and deliver specific parts of the video, often out of sequence.
	    - Ensuring a seamless experience despite these interruptions adds complexity to the system.

- *Packet Loss and Retransmission:*
	- **Video packets may be lost:**
	    - Due to network errors or congestion, some packets may never reach the client.
	- **Retransmission needed:**
	    - Lost packets might need to be retransmitted, which can delay playback and degrade the user experience.
	    - Alternatively, some systems use **error correction** to recover lost packets without retransmitting.
