# Docker
### What is Docker?
- Docker is a tool that allows developers, sys-admins etc. to easily deploy their applications in a sandbox (called _containers_) to run on the host operating system i.e. Linux. The key benefit of Docker is that it allows users to **package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit** for software development. Unlike virtual machines, containers do not have high overhead and hence enable more efficient usage of the underlying system and resources.
### What are containers?
- Today, Virtual Machines (VMs) are commonly used to run software. VMs create a separate Operating System (OS) on virtual hardware, running inside the host OS. This provides strong isolation, meaning issues in one system rarely affect the other. However, this comes with high computational costs.
- Containers offer a lighter alternative by using the host OS’s features, giving similar isolation with much less computing power.
### Why use containers?
- Containers package applications so they can run consistently in any environment, from data centers to the cloud or a developer’s laptop. This isolation makes deployment easier and more predictable.
- Beyond portability, containers improve resource efficiency, allowing better control over computing power. Because of these benefits, companies like Google, Facebook, and Netflix widely use containers to boost productivity and optimize infrastructure. Google even credited containers for eliminating the need for a whole data center.
