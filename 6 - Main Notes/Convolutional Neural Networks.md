# Convolutional Neural Networks

## Introduction:
- CNN is a type of artificial neural networks, paticularly welll-suited for image and video analysis tasks, are widely used in computer vision, driving-cars, facial recognition and other applications.
## How it works:
- Here is a basic architecture of a CNN model:
	1. **Convolutional Layers**: The network consists of multiple convolutional layers that apply filters (small kernels) to the input image, scanning it from left to right and top to bottom. This process detects edges, shapes, and other features in the image.
	2. **Activation Functions**: After each convolutional layer, an activation function is applied to introduce non-linearity into the model. Common choices include ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) and Sigmoid.
	3. **Pooling Layers**: The output of each convolutional layer is then downsampled using pooling layers, which reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps while retaining important information.
	4. **Fully Connected Layers**: The output of the convolutional and pooling layers is fed into fully connected (dense) layers to generate a final prediction.
