# Fourier series and transform

### Fourier seriers 
- a fourier series is a mathematical representation of a periodic function as a sum of simpler fumctions called harmonics or sine waves.
	- Can be written as:
	-  $$ f(x) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left[ a_n \cos\left(\frac{n \pi x}{L}\right) + b_n \sin\left(\frac{n \pi x}{L}\right) \right]. $$
### Fourier transform 
- Is an mathematical operation that transforms a function in the time domain to its frequenct domain representation.
