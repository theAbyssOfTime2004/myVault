# Early Forest-Fire Detection Utilizing Regression Models

*Keyword: forest fire detection, lasso regression, ridge regression, linear regression*

- **Abstract summarized** : 
	- Many methods were proposed, such as Neural network models, 3d otsu method, NMDI methodology,... but all have a certain limitations.
	- Linear, Ridge and Lasso regression have been implemented and utilized for this study since they those have provided a quite decent accurate solution
	
### Introduction summarized:
- The need of early detecting forest fire has been increased since 2020 due to dry days and considerable decrease
- Traditional Models such as GLMs were used to model fire distribution 
- In this study, the authors:
	- **Propose a new approach** for detecting forest fires early.
	- **Motivation:** Previous research methods had _shortcomings_ â€” maybe in accuracy, speed, or practicality.    
	- **Goal #1:** Detect fires **as early as possible**, ideally _right when they start_.    
	- **Goal #2:** Help **prevent the fire from spreading**, to reduce environmental and economic damage.

- The **limitations of traditional techniques** in:
- *Classification*    
- *Object recognition*    
- *Image segmentation*    
	- Those can be **overcome by using deep learning** in vision-based systems, also the authors **prefer stage 2 models** over **stage 1** for higher accuracy, which is critical in forest fire detection to avoid false alarms or missed detections.
- There are 4 degrees of possible forest-fire:
	- 1. Early response scenarios: predicted *damage area < 10 hectares, not been burning >= 3 hours, windspeed < 2m/s*,  local
