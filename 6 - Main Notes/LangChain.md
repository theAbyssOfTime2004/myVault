# LangChain

### Introduction 
- Langchain is an open source framework that allows AI developers to combine LLMS like gpt 4 with external sources of computation and data.
- Is currently offered in python and typescript
### Content
- Langchain allow you to connect alot of LLM to your own sources of data, referencing and linking your own database to the LLM, other than that you can have langchain to take action that you want to take (for instance: send email)
- How it works?
	-  taking document that you want your language model to reference, then slice it into smaller chunks, and store those chunks in a victor database, meaning they are vector embedding of text
